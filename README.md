NewRelic alerts via SMS
=========================

#### tl;dr
    1. update settings.py.sample, save as settings.py
    2. python scripts.py configure_db
    3. python webhook.py

#### Why?
    With NewRelic webhooks, one can write a custom web app to play with alerts.
    Here is an attempt to send an SMS whenever we receive an alert.

    NewRelic doesnt give us an interface to add users to a plugin's alerts, this
    project gives a web and REST api based interface to manage users data and
    plugin alerts.

#### How?
    Configuring:
    Read this https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/webhook-examples. Create a channel
    for webhook and go to an alert policy(should be found in tools>alert policy)
    add this webhook as an alert channel. Now whenever an alert is raised from this alert policy,
    a SMS will be sent to the corresponding users in user channels.
    A SMS is also sent to the default person.

    Starting:
    Change settings.py.sample and run python db_configure.py, this will configure
    the database with your plugins, users. You are all set, run python webhook.py.
    If python complains about missing librarys, install them and re-run the command.
    It starts a service at port 8080(configurable). Use something like runscope.com,
    if you want to test it with newrelic, before deploying.
    With runscope.com, you can quickly expose a localservice to public.

    Updating:
    Any change in settings.py file can be quickly consumed by the app without restarting by sending it
    a USR1 signal. Ex: ps aux | grep webhook #note down the pid and then run this command,
    kill -s USR1 pid the service will pick the new set of plugins.

    Visit localhost:8080/usage, to manage users and to subscribe to a plugin.

#### Additional features:
    1. Phone call on critical errors
    2. Add graphs to the dashboard
